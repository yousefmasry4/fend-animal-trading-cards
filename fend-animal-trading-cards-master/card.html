          <p id="summary">For all of their roaring, growling, and ferociousness, lions are family 		animals and truly social in their own communities. They usually live in groups of 15 or more 	   animals called prides. Prides can be as small as 3 or as big as 40 animals. In a pride, lions 		hunt prey, raise cubs, and defend their territory together.
      </p>
      <p>Their eyes are disproportionately large, having the largest eye-to-body size ratio of all mammals. These huge eyes provide this nocturnal animal with excellent night vision.</p>
